# Hey, I'm Alvin Mike 👋  |  @vrxmike

**Fullstack Software Engineer** (Backend-Specialized)  
**ALX Africa Software Engineering Graduate** (12-month Programme, 70+ hrs/week)  
**Certified** with **Backend Specialization** completed 🎓  
Built scalable backends + full application flows from foundations to production-grade labs and projects.

### 🌱 About Me
- Fullstack-capable engineer with strong backend focus
- **Low-level mastery**: C (data structures, memory, systems from ALX Foundations)
- **Backend expertise**: Python (FastAPI/Flask/Django patterns), Node.js/Express, REST/GraphQL APIs, auth (JWT/OAuth), databases & caching
- **Frontend foundations**: HTML/CSS/JS (from curriculum), enough to build/test full apps and pair with frontend devs
- **Databases & tools**: MySQL/PostgreSQL, Redis, NoSQL concepts, Git, Linux/shell, Docker basics, testing suites
- Still passionate about: Secure coding (cybersecurity basics/pentesting concepts), AI backend integration, performance & system design

### 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Languages** — Python • JavaScript/TypeScript • C
- **Backend** — FastAPI • Flask • Express • API security & scaling
- **Frontend basics** — HTML/CSS/JS (for fullstack flows)
- **Databases** — MySQL • PostgreSQL • Redis
- **Dev Tools** — Git • Linux • Docker • CI/CD awareness
- **Next up** — Go/Rust, cloud platforms (AWS/GCP), DevSecOps

### 🏆 Key Milestones
- Completed full ALX Foundations → Backend Specialization → 12-month Programme
- Received official **ALX Software Engineering Certificate** (Backend focus)
- Hands-on ALX graded projects/capstones: storage engines, auth systems, scalable services
- Built & iterated on **private labs/projects** (full API-driven apps, secure backends, integrated flows — some open-sourcing soon)

### 💞️ Open to Collaborate / Work With
- Fullstack or backend-heavy projects (Python/Node preferred)
- Side hustles where strong backend pairs with frontend
- Open-source in security, AI tools, dev tooling
- **Job opps** — fullstack/backend roles, freelance, startups in Nairobi/global
