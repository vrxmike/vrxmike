# Hey, I'm Alvin Mike 👋  |  @vrxmike

**Fullstack Software Engineer** (Backend-Specialized)  
**ALX Africa Software Engineering Graduate** (13-month Programme, 70+ hrs/week)  
**Certified** with **Backend Specialization** completed 🎓  
Building scalable, secure full applications — from low-level foundations to cloud-deployed, cyber-hardened backends.

### 🌱 About Me
- Fullstack-capable with strong backend focus
- **Low-level mastery**: C (data structures, memory management, systems programming from ALX Foundations)
- **Backend expertise**: Python (FastAPI/Flask), Node.js/Express, REST/GraphQL APIs, auth (JWT/OAuth), databases & scaling
- **Frontend foundations**: React/Next.js •HTML/CSS/JS for complete app flows and pairing with specialists
- Passionate about secure, cloud-native development — blending backend with **cloud infrastructure** and **cybersecurity** best practices

### 🔧 Tech Stack
- **Languages** — Python • JavaScript/TypeScript • C
- **Backend** — FastAPI • Flask • Express • API design, security & performance
- **Frontend basics** — React/Next.js • HTML/CSS/JS (fullstack integration)
- **Databases** — MySQL • PostgreSQL • Redis • NoSQL concepts
- **Cloud & Security** — Google Cloud Platform (GCP) tools/infrastructure • Cybersecurity fundamentals (offensive/defensive, pentesting concepts, tools like Metasploit/Wireshark)
- **Dev Tools** — Git • Linux/shell • Docker basics • Testing (unittest/pytest)
- **Next level** — Go/Rust for perf, full DevSecOps, advanced GCP/AWS

### 🏆 Key Milestones
- Completed full ALX Foundations → Backend Specialization → 12-month Software Engineering Programme
- Received official **ALX Software Engineering Certificate** (Backend focus)
- Hands-on ALX projects/capstones: storage engines, auth systems, scalable services
- Built & iterated on **private labs/projects** (API-driven apps, secure backends, integrated flows — some open-sourcing soon)

### 🚀 Currently Leveling Up
- **ALX Google Cloud Skills Programme** (8-week exclusive hands-on with Google — cloud infrastructure, deployment, earning GCP certs/badges for scalable apps)
- **ALX Cybersecurity Programme** (7-month track — offensive/defensive security, GRC, tools like Metasploit, Wireshark; hardening backends against real threats)

### 💞️ Open to Collaborate / Work With
- Fullstack/backend projects (Python/Node, cloud-integrated)
- Secure API/services, pentest-aware apps, cloud deployments
- Open-source in security tooling, AI backends, cloud/dev tools
- **Job opps** — fullstack/backend/devsecops roles, freelance, startups (Nairobi/remote/global)
